# JAWS-UG Administration Code of Conduct - Code of Conduct -

All those who are or will be engaged in community activities in the name of JAWS-UG are requested to observe the following code of conduct. This code of conduct is valid both online and offline.

## JAWS-UG Community Philosophy

The community that operates under the name of JAWS-UG should treat AWS, provided by Amazon Web Services Japan (AWS Japan), with love. The use of the JAWS-UG name for excessive self-promotion, job recruitment, or other commercial purposes is never allowed.

## Expected behavior

* To the extent possible, please provide your abilities to the community. The community exists because of your contributions.
* Please remember to be considerate of those who are new to the community. Remember that the first time anyone comes into contact with a community can be a scary experience.
* Please do your best to ensure that all participants, including those who are new to the event, can enjoy the event.

## Unacceptable behavior

* It is not appropriate to use the JAWS-UG name to show off your influence without contributing to the community.
* It is not appropriate for the organizing members to hang out together at the event venue, or to get excited about things that only they understand, such as using unusual abbreviations or talking about inside jokes.
* It is not appropriate to criticize, abuse or ridicule each other, unless you do so with love and affection.
* Expressions related to the race, gender, sexual orientation, physical characteristics, appearance, politics, religion (or lack of religion) etc. of those involved are not appropriate in any case.

# Structure of JAWS-UG

## Constituent Units

The community that operates under the name of JAWS-UG is required to be composed of units called “chapters”, which are grouped according to specific regions, specific interests, etc. However, these chapters may exist either online or offline.

## Structure of the Management Team

The JAWS-UG management team welcomes all those who contribute to the JAWS-UG community as core members. Core members are grouped into chapters, and all members are honored as contributors representing their chapters.

We assume that participation in the core members is usually preceded by some kind of contribution, or by the establishment of mutual respect and trust with other core members during the preparation stage of a project that you intend to contribute to.

All core members within a chapter have a flat relationship, but of course it is possible that core members who can bring together the opinions within the chapter or take on specific tasks will arise spontaneously or inevitably. In such cases, there is no problem with them calling themselves “Publicity Manager”, “Banquet Manager”, “Advertising Sales”, “Liaison Officer”, etc. externally, but this is not considered to be authority, but a role (role).

## About starting a new chapter

If you are a contributor who wants to discuss a topic that is not being discussed by an existing chapter or there is no chapter in your area, you can freely start a new chapter. Please contact existing contributors.

However, before planning to start a new chapter, please try to visit existing study sessions and events to get a feel for the atmosphere. It is not too late to start planning to start a chapter after communicating with the core members who are managing the study sessions and getting a grasp of the actual management.

There are several preconditions for establishing a branch.

In the past, there have been cases where branches have been set up but then stopped after the initial launch event. To avoid this, we believe it is essential to have follow-up support from other branches and the secretariat, and we have a number of requests for this purpose that are preconditions.


### Preconditions

* Please check the [Study Group List](https://jaws-ug.jp/act/) to see if there are any existing study groups in the same area or with the same theme. Please avoid creating two study groups with the same concept.
* If there is a study group with the same concept that appears to be inactive, please contact us on the #general channel of the make-jawsug domain on Slack. With the cooperation of the people involved, please encourage the study group to be rebooted (restarted).
* Please make sure there are multiple contributors. If you are recruiting, please organize the chapter concept and recruit in the #general channel of the make-jawsug domain on Slack.
* To understand the management flow, please collaborate with an existing chapter and coordinate to become a sponsor of the chapter launch. If you are already active as a contributor to another chapter, a sponsor is not required.

### Chapter Establishment Procedure

* Check the [JAWS-UG Slack team](https://jaws-ug.jp/jaws-ug-slack/) and register with the make-jawsug domain on Slack.
* After organizing the following information, make a declaration of the establishment of the chapter in the #general channel and obtain agreement.

* Chapter name
* Concept
* Contributors
* Sponsor (not required if the contributor is a member of an existing chapter)
* Create an event page on Connpass and add “JAWS-UG Secretariat” as an administrator
* https://connpass.com/user/jaws-ug/

### About active and dormant chapters
Chapters that are active and displayed on the [list of study groups](https://jaws-ug.jp/act/) are recognized by JAWS-UG and Amazon Web Services Japan (AWS Japan). For a list of all study groups, including active and inactive groups, please refer to [this page](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ceDqZoXyFT92S7MwsvS9a6SrKnd0D1gssKJkDzIE4g/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Changing to Inactive Status
The switch from “active” to “inactive” is done in the following order.
- At the JAWS-UG general meeting held every March, we will contact chapters that have not held any study sessions for 12 months.
- Chapters that have not held any study sessions for one month after being contacted will be treated as “inactive”.
- We will contact the JAWS-UG General Assembly, #core-members${yyyymm}, and [Chapter Representatives](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ceDqZoXyFT92S7MwsvS9a6SrKnd0D1gssKJkDzIE4g/edit?usp=sharing), but even if we are unable to contact them, they will be treated as “inactive”.
- yyyymm is created in units of years

#### Changing to an active status
The switch from “inactive” to “active” is done in the following order.
- The study group activity is restarted.
- After the study group is held, contact is made with the JAWS-UG secretariat.

#### The reason for managing active and inactive status
This is because in the past there were chapters that did not hold study sessions but only borrowed the name of JAWS-UG to show off their influence. In order to avoid this situation and to be able to support chapters that are active, we are managing active and dormant chapters.

## About this code of conduct

This code of conduct is to be discussed by contributors in an open forum, and will be continually revised to suit the current situation of JAWS-UG. Those who have opinions on this code of conduct can openly discuss them on the above slack, and participants should avoid preventing this.
